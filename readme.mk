I have been tossing around the idea of implementing a MIPS1 chip similar to the R3000 (I have a lot of nostalgia for a certian grey box from the 90s). 
Unfortunately I haven't worked much with the MIPS_1 architecture directly so I wanted to try to create an assembler to familiarize myself with the ISA before diving into a larger project using it.

I will update this documentation when the assembler is up and running but for the moment assume it is non-functional.
